# Mind-Match using AI techniques and strategies game.


Mind Match is a fun and interactive memory game built using JavaScript. The game is designed to help players improve their memory skills by challenging them to match pairs of cards with identical images. The game is played by flipping over cards, two at a time, in an effort to find matching pairs. As players progress through the game, the number of cards and difficulty level increase, making the game more challenging and engaging. Mind Match is a great way to keep your mind sharp while having fun!
